## Lessons Learned

### Day 1 (2025-02-17)

#### Environment Setup
1. **Issue**: Initial connection to Tavily MCP server failed
   ```
   Fatal error: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified
   ```
   - **Root Cause**: Missing proper Node.js/npx setup and error handling
   - **Solution**: Added comprehensive error handling and initialization checks
   - **Best Practice**: Always validate external dependencies during startup

2. **Project Structure**
   - Importance of separating concerns (client, LLM, database)
   - Benefits of using a modular approach for easier testing
   - Value of comprehensive logging from the start

3. **Documentation**
   - Created dedicated docs folder for tracking progress
   - Implementing documentation-driven development
   - Maintaining clear record of decisions and lessons

### Technical Insights

#### MCP Client Implementation
```python
# Key Pattern: Proper resource management
async def cleanup(self):
    """Clean up resources"""
    if self.session:
        try:
            await self.exit_stack.aclose()
            logger.info("Successfully cleaned up")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error during cleanup: {e}")
```

#### Best Practices Identified
1. **Error Handling**
   - Use specific exception types
   - Implement proper cleanup in finally blocks
   - Log errors with context

2. **Resource Management**
   - Use async context managers
   - Implement proper cleanup methods
   - Handle disconnections gracefully

3. **Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Validate all required variables at startup
   - Provide clear error messages for missing config

## Architecture Decisions

### MCP Client Design
1. **Decision**: Use AsyncExitStack for resource management
   - **Context**: Need to manage multiple async resources
   - **Consequence**: Cleaner resource cleanup
   - **Trade-off**: Added complexity vs. robustness

2. **Decision**: Implement comprehensive logging
   - **Context**: Debug complex integrations
   - **Consequence**: Better troubleshooting
   - **Trade-off**: Performance impact vs. observability

### Database Integration
1. **Decision**: Use Supabase for storage
   - **Context**: Need for structured data storage
   - **Consequence**: SQL capabilities with modern API
   - **Trade-off**: External dependency vs. functionality

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Resolve Tavily MCP server connection
2. Implement robust error handling
3. Add session management
4. Enhance logging system

### Future Considerations
1. Performance optimization
2. Enhanced error recovery
3. Better user feedback
4. Result caching

## Questions to Address

1. How to handle long-running research sessions?
2. What's the best way to structure research results?
3. How to implement efficient result caching?
4. What metrics should we track for optimization?

Lessons Learned
Day 1 (2025-02-17)
[Previous lessons remain the same...]
Day 2 (2025-02-17 - Later)
Code Organization Lessons

Import Structure Issues

Issue: Client was trying to import Config class that didn't exist

pythonCopy# Incorrect:
from .config import Config  # Config didn't exist

Solution: Created proper Config class and reorganized code structure
Best Practice: Define clear class responsibilities and maintain single source of truth


Configuration Management

Implemented configuration using dataclass for type safety
Centralized all configuration in dedicated config.py
Added validation for required environment variables
Learning: Configuration needs to be self-contained and validated early

Error Handling Strategy

Added comprehensive error handling in Config class
Implemented proper cleanup in client
Added logging throughout the codebase
Learning: Error handling needs to be consistent and informative



Technical Insights

Configuration Pattern

pythonCopy@dataclass
class Config:
    """Configuration settings for the MCP client."""
    anthropic_api_key: str
    supabase_url: str
    supabase_key: str
    tavily_api_key: str
    
    @classmethod
    def load_from_env(cls) -> 'Config':
        # Centralized environment loading

Learning: Using dataclasses provides better type safety and self-documentation


Client Initialization

pythonCopyasync def initialize(self) -> bool:
    try:
        # Validate configuration first
        self.config.validate()
        # Then connect to services
        await self.connect_to_tavily()
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to initialize: {e}")
        raise

Learning: Initialization should be sequential and validate prerequisites

Major Architecture Insight: Dynamic Capability Discovery

Initial Problem:

Original implementation was hardcoded to specific tools (e.g., Tavily)
Assumed presence of specific capabilities
Not truly MCP-compliant


Key Learning:

MCP requires dynamic capability discovery
No assumptions about available tools/resources
LLM should plan based on discovered capabilities


Implementation Changes:
pythonCopy# Before - Hardcoded approach
async def search(self, query: str):
    result = await self.client.execute_tool(
        "tavily-search",  # Hardcoded tool
        {"query": query}
    )

# After - Dynamic approach
async def search(self, query: str):
    capabilities = await self.client.discover_capabilities()
    plan = await self.llm.plan_research(query, capabilities)
    results = await self.execute_plan(plan)

Benefits Discovered:

Works with any MCP server
Automatically adapts to available capabilities
More robust and maintainable
True to MCP principles


Best Practices Identified:

Always discover capabilities at startup
Let LLM analyze available capabilities
Plan execution based on what's available
Handle missing capabilities gracefully



Technical Implementation

New Components Added:

Capability discovery system
Capability analysis by LLM
Dynamic execution planning
Flexible result handling


Code Organization Improvements:

Separated capability discovery
Added capability analysis layer
Improved error handling for missing capabilities


Integration Changes:

Modified client initialization
Updated LLM orchestration
Enhanced error handling



Next Steps Identified

Testing Needs:

Test with different capability sets
Verify capability discovery
Test missing capability handling


Documentation Updates:

Document capability discovery
Explain dynamic planning
Update architecture diagrams


Future Improvements:

Add capability caching
Implement capability updates
Add capability requirement validation
